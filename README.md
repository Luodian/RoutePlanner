# RoutePlanner
This project is a tutorial on building a route planner system. The system finds the fastest route of any two given startpoint and  destination, and the estimated time of the route, after analysing one day's taxi trajectories, and a road map of a city.

This tutorial focuses on the algorithms to build a route planner system.

### Included Algorithms
