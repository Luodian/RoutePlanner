# RoutePlanner
This project is a tutorial on building a route planner system. The system finds the fastest route of any given startpoints and destinations, and the estimated time of the route, after analysing one day's taxi trajectories, and the road map of a city.

This tutorial focuses on the algorithms to build a route planner system.

### Included Algorithms
* Improved Ramer-Douglas algorithm
* K-d Tree
* Dijkstra algorithm
* HMM model and verbiti algorithm
* Improved A* algorithm
